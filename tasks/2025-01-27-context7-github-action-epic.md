# Context7 GitHub Action Integration Epic

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNING  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Goal**: Add Upsert Context7 GitHub Action to repository with automatic updates after successful release script runs

## Epic Overview

Integrate the Upsert Context7 GitHub Action into the Riteway repository to provide up-to-date code documentation for LLMs and AI code editors, with automatic updates triggered after successful release script runs.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Research Context7 Upsert Action
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PENDING  
**Context**: Need to understand Context7 Upsert action specifications, configuration options, and requirements  
**Requirements**:

- Given the repository structure, should understand how Context7 integrates with existing workflows

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Context7 Upsert action specifications documented
- [ ] Configuration options and requirements identified
- [ ] Integration approach with existing release.js workflow planned

**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  
**Agent Orchestration**: Required (web search for research)

### Task 2: Set Up GitHub Actions Infrastructure
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PENDING  
**Context**: Repository currently has no GitHub Actions workflows - need to create the infrastructure  
**Requirements**:
- Given a repository without GitHub Actions, should create .github/workflows directory structure
- Given the need for CI/CD, should establish workflow foundation

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] .github/workflows/ directory created
- [ ] Basic workflow structure established
- [ ] GitHub Actions permissions and settings configured

**Dependencies**: Task 1 completion  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

### Task 3: Integrate Upsert Context7 Action
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PENDING  
**Context**: Add the actual Context7 Upsert action to the workflow  
**Requirements**:
- Given the Context7 specifications, should implement the action in workflow
- Given the repository structure, should ensure proper configuration

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Upsert Context7 action added to workflow
- [ ] Action properly configured with repository settings
- [ ] Action tested and validated

**Dependencies**: Tasks 1 and 2 completion  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required

### Task 4: Configure Automatic Release Integration
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PENDING  
**Context**: Integrate Context7 updates with existing release.js workflow  
**Requirements**:
- Given a successful release script run, should automatically trigger Context7 updates
- Given the existing release.js workflow, should integrate seamlessly without breaking functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Release workflow triggers Context7 updates
- [ ] Integration doesn't interfere with existing release process
- [ ] Automatic updates working correctly

**Dependencies**: Task 3 completion  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  
**Agent Orchestration**: Required (JavaScript/Node.js expertise for release.js integration)

### Task 5: Testing and Validation
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PENDING  
**Context**: Ensure complete workflow integration works correctly  
**Requirements**:
- Given the complete workflow, should validate all components work together
- Given the integration, should ensure no regressions in existing functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete workflow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Release process validated with Context7 integration
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Dependencies**: Task 4 completion  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  
**Agent Orchestration**: Required (systematic testing approach)

## Implementation Notes

- Must ensure workflow doesn't interfere with existing release process
- Should follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Consider security implications of automatic updates
- Need to research exact Context7 Upsert action configuration
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing release.js script

## Questions for Clarification

1. Do you have specific requirements for the Context7 Upsert action configuration?
2. Should the Context7 updates happen immediately after release or on a schedule?
3. Are there any specific GitHub repository settings or permissions I should be aware of?

## Success Metrics

- Context7 Upsert action successfully integrated
- Automatic updates working after releases
- No disruption to existing release workflow
- Complete end-to-end testing validated
