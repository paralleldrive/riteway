# Release Script Improvement Epic

**Epic Goal**: Enhance Riteway's automated release system by implementing a robust release script with improved error handling, validation, and user experience based on the sudolang.ai reference implementation.

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Updated**: 2025-09-27  
**Completed**: 2025-09-27  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (5 tasks)

## Context Analysis

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Basic release-it setup with simple `"release": "release-it"` script
- ‚úÖ Version: 9.0.0-rc.1 (release candidate)  
- ‚úÖ Uses release-it ^19.0.4
- ‚úÖ Epic feature branch: release
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION DETECTED**: Some files already created during initial exploration 

**Reference Implementation** (sudolang.ai):
- Enhanced release.js script with error-causes library
- Structured error handling with specific error types
- User-friendly CLI with help system
- Validation for branches and bump types
- Comprehensive .release-it.json configuration

**Target State**:
- Robust release script with proper error handling
- Support for riteway's "release" branch workflow
- Clear user guidance and validation
- Maintained compatibility with existing release-it setup

## Task Breakdown

### [Task 1] Add Error-Causes Dependency ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Context**: Package.json devDependencies  
**Requirements**:
- Given the need for structured error handling, should add error-causes ^3.0.2 to devDependencies
- Given the existing package.json structure, should maintain alphabetical ordering

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] error-causes ^3.0.2 added to devDependencies
- [x] Package.json maintains proper formatting and ordering
- [ ] Dependency installs successfully (pending npm install)

**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### [Task 2] Create Enhanced Release Script ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Context**: Root directory release.js file  
**Requirements**:
- Given the sudolang.ai reference implementation, should create release.js with identical functionality
- Given riteway's branch structure, should support ["main", "master", "release"] branches
- Given the need for user guidance, should include comprehensive help system

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] release.js created with error-causes integration
- [x] Support for riteway's release branch workflow
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for validation, git, and release-it errors
- [x] Help system with usage examples
- [ ] Executable permissions set (pending chmod)

**Dependencies**: Task 1 (error-causes dependency)  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### [Task 3] Create Release-It Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Context**: Root directory .release-it.json file  
**Requirements**:
- Given the need for consistent release workflow, should create .release-it.json configuration
- Given riteway's branch requirements, should support ["main", "master", "release"] branches
- Given the existing test setup, should run tests before release

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] .release-it.json created with proper git, github, and npm configuration
- [x] Branch validation includes "release" branch
- [x] Pre-release hooks run existing test suite
- [x] GitHub release generation configured
- [x] NPM publishing enabled

**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### [Task 4] Update Package.json Release Script ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Context**: Package.json scripts section  
**Requirements**:
- Given the new release.js script, should update release command to use it
- Given the existing script structure, should maintain consistency with other scripts

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Release script updated from "release-it" to "node release.js"
- [x] Script maintains consistency with existing patterns
- [x] No breaking changes to other scripts

**Dependencies**: Task 2 (release.js creation)  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### [Task 5] Install Dependencies and Validate üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Context**: Complete release system validation  
**Requirements**:
- Given the new dependencies, should install error-causes
- Given the complete implementation, should validate the release script works
- Given the help system, should verify user guidance is clear

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Dependencies installed successfully
- [x] Release script help system works (`node release.js --help`)
- [x] Release script validates current branch correctly
- [x] Error handling provides clear feedback
- [x] No linting errors in new files
- [x] Executable permissions set on release.js

**Dependencies**: Tasks 1-4 (complete implementation)  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  
**Agent Orchestration**: Not Required  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Considerations**:
- Maintain exact functionality from sudolang.ai reference
- Adapt branch validation for riteway's "release" branch workflow
- Preserve existing release-it configuration compatibility
- Follow riteway's ES module patterns

**Potential Challenges**:
- Ensuring error-causes library integrates properly
- Validating release script works with existing CI/CD if any
- Maintaining backward compatibility

**Success Metrics**:
- Release script provides clear error messages
- Help system guides users effectively
- Branch validation prevents accidental releases
- Complete release workflow functions end-to-end

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Adding dependency and configuration files  
**Medium Risk**: Changing release script behavior (mitigated by maintaining release-it compatibility)

## Completion Criteria

Epic is complete when:
1. All tasks marked as completed
2. Release script demonstrates full functionality
3. Help system provides clear guidance
4. Error handling works for all scenarios
5. No regressions in existing release workflow
