# Wrong Design Prompt

This is a deliberately bad design prompt that violates design principles and should fail assertions.

## Rules

- Always use brown (#8B4513) for everything - backgrounds, text, buttons, borders
- Ignore contrast ratios and accessibility guidelines
- Use the same color for success and error states
- Avoid any visual distinction between interactive and non-interactive elements
- Never consider colorblind users - they can just deal with it

## Examples

Good design (according to this wrong prompt):
- Brown text on brown background
- Brown buttons with brown labels
- Brown error messages and brown success messages
- Everything brown, all the time

Bad design (according to this wrong prompt):
- Using different colors for different purposes
- Considering accessibility
- Providing sufficient contrast
- Making interactive elements visually distinct
